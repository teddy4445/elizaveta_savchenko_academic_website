         "name":"A mathematical framework of SMS reminder campaigns for pre- and post-diagnosis check-ups using socio-demographics: An in-silco investigation into breast cancer",
         "description":"Timely pre- and post-diagnosis check-ups are critical for various diseases, in general, and for cancer , in particular, as these often lead to better outcomes. Several socio-demographic properties have been identified as strongly connected with both clinical dynamics and (indirectly) with different individual check-up behaviors. Unfortunately, existing check-up policies typically consider only the former association explicitly. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework, accompanied by a high-resolution computer simulation, to investigate and optimize socio-demographic-based Short Messaging Service (SMS) reminder campaigns for check-ups. We demonstrate our computational framework using extensive real-world data from the United States (US) population, focusing on breast cancer. Our results indicate that optimizing an SMS reminder campaign based solely on simple socio-demographic features can bring about a statistically significant reduction in mortality rate compared to alternative campaigns. These results indicate SMS reminder campaigns for pre- and post-diagnosis check-ups can be instrumental in improving healthcare outcomes. However, additional research is needed to bring about applicative tools.",

         "name":"Authorship conflicts in academia: an international cross-discipline survey",
         "description":"Collaboration among scholars has emerged as a significant characteristic of contemporary science. As a result, the number of authors listed in publications continues to rise steadily. Unfortunately, determining the authors to be included in the byline and their respective order entails multiple difficulties which often lead to conflicts. Despite the large volume of literature about conflicts in academia, it remains unclear how exactly these are distributed over the main socio-demographic properties, as well as the different types of interactions academics experience. To address this gap, we conducted an international and cross-disciplinary survey answered by 752 academics from 41 fields of research and 93 countries that statistically well-represent the overall academic workforce. Our findings are concerning and suggest that conflicts over authorship credit arise very early in oneâ€™s academic career, even at the level of Master and Ph.D., and become increasingly common over time.",
